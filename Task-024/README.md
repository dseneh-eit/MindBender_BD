## Task 0024 - Coding Challenge

### Duration: 1hr

### Question: 
- Build a Refrigerator using object-oriented programming principles (preferably java language).
You only need to implement two methods, put() and get(). Put() will alow you to put objects into the refrigerator, get() will allow you to get it back. Keep in mind a refrigerator may have a different type of shelves, for simplicity, assume there are three sizes SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE type of shelves, but many of them.

- Tips:

* You have to make sure there is enough space in shelve before putting objects into it, Handle errors when someone tries to put objects when no sufficient space left.

* Arrange the efficiently to maximize space utilization. For example, putting a small one in the large shelf will work but it will be inefficient.

 You may also need to rearrange to make space.

* get() method also needs to handle potential error situations such as trying to get objects which are not in the refrigerator.
